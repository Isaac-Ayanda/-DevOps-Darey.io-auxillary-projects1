# AUX Project 1: Shell Scripting
Users creation automation using Shell Script.

In this project, I utilized shell scripting skills to automate the creation of 20 new users  unto an AWS Linux server by creating a shell script that reads a csv file containing the first names of the users to be onboarded, created their home directory, apply permissions, created, copied and saved their authorised keys in their individual ssh folders. Any of the newly created users are able to log unto the server successfully.
